## Genesis {#sec-genesis .unnumbered}

This book owes it origin to an initiative the Bank of England began in the early 1990s, and a prescient one. This was at a major historical turning point, one that signalled a burgeoning new world order, as the Iron Curtain crumbled, the European experiment gathered momentum, and industrial might continued an inexorable shift eastwards.
