## Genesis {#sec-genesis .unnumbered}

This book is the product of an initiative taken by the Bank of England in the early 1990s. It was decided that the Bank should create a forum where the central bankers of the world could gather to commune, discuss, and above all, learn together. Central banking had long been associated with grey men in grey suits, pondering deeply the impenetrable decisions of high finance, fuelled by cigar smoke and mystique. In truth, this Capraesque view was substantially out of date. Central bankers were no longer monochrome, or exclusively male, and needed skills their forebears could have barely imagined -- and had most decidedly different priorities. 

The timing, of course, was not incidental, and the initiative turned out to be a prescient one. This was at a major historical turning point, one that signalled a burgeoning new world order, as the Iron Curtain crumbled, the European experiment gathered momentum, and industrial might continued an inexorable shift eastwards. Economic policy had shifted too. Monetary policy was beginning a new and -- as it turned out -- lasting phase. There was indeed much to learn, and so the Centre for Central Banking Studies was instituted. More than thirty years later it remains a key forum for learning, discussion and networking, just as intended. Activities have evolved to include many more of the disparate areas of responsibility that now involve the central banking community, and with a truly global reach.
